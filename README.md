# BTC, ETH & LTC price tracker PWA

## Description

This application is based upon the tutorial written by Medium user: Yomi. You can see it here: [Build a Realtime PWA with React](https://medium.com/better-programming/build-a-realtime-pwa-with-react-99e7b0fd3270).

I have updated the app to use ES6 syntax and React functional components. I also implemented a custom React Hook by Michael Theodorou described in this article: [useStatus: A Custom React Hook for Managing UI States](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/usestatus-a-custom-react-hook-for-managing-ui-states-a5b1bc6555bf).

This project is only intended for personal use and development practice. Thanks to both those developers for putting the articles together!
